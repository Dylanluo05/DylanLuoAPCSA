<p>To start off, I am grateful for all my loved ones. I am thankful for my family, who have provided me with so much support and love through tje ups and downs of my life. I truly believe that I would not have succeeded nearly as much if it was not for my family. In addition, my friends have supported me greatly and have helped my through rough times. Looking back at how much they have aided me makes me feel extremely appreciative for all of them. Moving forward into the future, I seek to maintain a close group of friends and preserve a good relationship with my relatives, for the sake my own mental health, as well as for me to give support back to my loved ones.</p>
