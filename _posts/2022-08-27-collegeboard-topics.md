        <h2>Unit 1: Primitive Types</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In Java, there are primitive and non-primitive data types. Some primitive data types include int, double and boolean, and some non-primitive data types include String and array.</p>
        <h3>Data Types:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>int: Used for all integers.</li>
            <li>double: Used for numbers with decimals.</li>
            <li>boolean: Used for all boolean values, which are usually two return values that typically vary between true or false.</li>
            <li>String: Used for all text values.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Java Input:</h3>
        <p>"static" or "hard coded" programs typically when all of the website information is displayed by default. There are no instances of user input in these types of programs.</p>
        <p>To increase user interaction, having user inputs is important</p>
        <p>In Java, Scanner is the utility class used for console user input</p>
        <p>All programming has the means of formatting and combining data. An example of this is shown through concatenation (e.g. "Hello," + " World!" = "Hello, World!". The "+" symbol combined the two strings).</p>
        <h2>Unit 2: Using Objects</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The relationship between a class and an object is that a class is essentially a template for an object, and an object is an instance of a class.</p>
        <h3>Other College Board Topics related to this unit:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>A 2D array can be used to store colors.</li>
            <li>A control structure can be used to process menu selections. A switch can be used to run code that performs the related action of a selection.</li>
            <li>A 1D array can be used to hold a menu.</li>
            <li>A control structure such as if-else if-else can be used to process menu selections by running code that performs the related action of a selection.</li>
            <li>Class inheritance.</li>
            <li>Conditional statements, while loops, and boolean expressions.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Some Java imports are designated toward allowing user input and console output in the terminal.</p>
        <p>The Scanner class makes an object to collect inputs / menu selections from users</p>
        <p>The System class can be used to call static methods like System.out.print() and System.out.println() to output in the console.</p>
        <p>The Math class can be used to call the static method Math.random() to generate a random number within a specified range.</p>
        <p>Objects are often intended to encapsulate Frontend, Backend, Web Site control flow, Database CRUD Operations, and many more.</p>
        <p>With Swing and AWT imports, Java has the ability to provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI) on the desktop.</p>
