# Anatomy of Java

## Static
The class HelloStatic contains the classic "Hello, World!" message that is often used as an introduction to a programming language. The "public static void main(String[] args)", or main method, is the default runtime method in Java and has a very specific and ordered definition (signature).

### Static Key Terms
* "class" is a blueprint for code, it is the code definition and must be called to run
* "method" or "static method" in this case, is the code to be run/executed, similar to a procedure
* "method definition" or "signature" are the keywords "public static void" in front of the name "main" and the parameters "String[] args" after the name.
* "method call" is the means in which we run the defined code
