## Code.org Key Learnings ##
* In Java, an object can be created using the public objectName{} command.
* An object is an instance of a class, and it has its own identity, state, and purpose. The state of an object is stored in variables or fields, and it can be used using functions or methods.
* In Java, the public class subclassName extends superclassName{} command links a subclass to a superclass. An example of subclassName could be soccer, while an example of superclassName could be sport.
