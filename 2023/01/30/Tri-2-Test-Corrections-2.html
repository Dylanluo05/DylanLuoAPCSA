    <ul>
      <li>Original Answer: A. Correct Answer: E.</li>
      <li>A is incorrect because in a string that has one or more occurrences of the letter “A,” the statement would discard the portion of str from the first occurence of “A” to the end. E is correct because the statement selects characters of str starting one character after pos.</li>
