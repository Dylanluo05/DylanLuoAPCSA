    "3. Users of a website are asked to provide a review of the website at the end of each visit. Each review, represented by an object of the Review class, consists of an integer indication the user's rating of the website and an optional String comment field. The comment field in a Review object ends with a period (\".\"), exclamation point (\"!\"), or letter, or is a String of length 0 if the user did not enter a comment.\n",

    "    a. Write the ReviewAnalysis method getAverageRating, which returns the average rating (arithmetic mean) of all elements of allReviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. Write the ReviewAnalysis method collectComments, which collects and formats only comments that contain an exclamation point. The method returns an ArrayList of String objects containing copies of user comments from allReviews that contain an exclamation point, formatted as follows. An empty ArrayList is returned if no comment in allReviews contains an exclamation point.\n",
    "    * The String inserted into the ArrayList to be returned begins with the index of Review in allReviews.\n",
    "    * The index is immediately followed by a hyphen (\"-\").\n",
    "    * The hyphen is followed by a copy of the original comment.\n",
    "    * The String must end with either a period or an exclamation point. If the original comment from allReviews does not end in either a period or an exclamation point, a period is added."
