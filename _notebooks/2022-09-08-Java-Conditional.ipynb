    "The Demorgan's Law basically uses the logical operators or, and, and nand. For two conditions paired with an ||(or) operator, the program will evaluate to true if at least one of the conditions evaluates to true. For two conditions paired with an &&(and) operator, the program will only evaluate to true only if both of the conditions evaluate to true. For two conditions paired with a !(not) operator, the program is reversed, as it will print true if the condition evaluates to false, and print false if the condition evaluates to true."
