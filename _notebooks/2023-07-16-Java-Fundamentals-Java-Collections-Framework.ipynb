    "* The Java Collections framework defines a group of classes that each have some sort of architecture used for grouping collections of individual objects. A framework is basically a platform of pre-written code (typically includes multitudes of classes and interfaces) used to assist programmers with creating applications, usually in the form of providing useful attributes and methods to help keep programmers' code concise.\n",
    "* The ArrayList class, which a part of the Java Collections framework, is essentially utilized to define a special type of array that is resizable and mutable. Basically, an ArrayList can change itself (size and content) dynamically. ArrayList is a Generic class, meaning it takes a parameterized type that specifies the data type it will work with (similar to defining the data type stored by an array).\n",
    "* An ArrayList basically stores an internal array within itself, and whenever the size of the internal array has to change to accommodate for appended or removed elements, the ArrayList copies all of the elements to a new array with the new changes implemented.\n",
    "* Whenever you remove an element from an ArrayList, the indices all of the elements after that element change (decrement by 1), as the ArrayList has to fill up the hole left by the removed element.\n",
    "* The capacity of an ArrayList is different from its size in that the capacity defines the number of elements the ArrayList can store without changing the size of its internal array, while the size is the number of actual data/elements saved within the ArrayList. The capacity of an ArrayList can be manually specified, but is by default 10 elements, and will dynamically grow with the elements appended to the ArrayList (after capacity has been exceeded), but will remain constant when elements are removed from the ArrayList (unless trimToSize() method is used). The size of an ArrayList starts off at 0 if the ArrayList is initialized as empty, and will change in correspondence to elements being added to or removed from the ArrayList.\n",
    "* The classes in the Collections framework are grouped by different interfaces (e.g. The list classes such as ArrayList and LinkedList implement the List interface)."
