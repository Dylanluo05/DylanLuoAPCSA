    "* The Java Collections framework defines a group of classes that each have some sort of architecture used for grouping collections of individual objects. A framework is basically a platform of pre-written code (typically includes multitudes of classes and interfaces) used to assist programmers with creating applications, usually in the form of providing useful attributes and methods to help keep programmers' code concise.\n",
    "* The ArrayList class, which a part of the Java Collections framework, is essentially utilized to define a special type of array that is resizable and mutable. Basically, an ArrayList can change itself (size and content) dynamically. ArrayList is a Generic class, meaning it takes a parameterized type that specifies the data type it will work with (similar to defining the data type stored by an array).\n",
    "* An ArrayList basically stores an internal array within itself, and whenever the internal array is updated whenever the ArrayList has to account for added or removed elements. When the size of the ArrayList exceeds its capacity, the ArrayList copies all of the elements to a new internal array with the new changes implemented.\n",
    "* Whenever you remove an element from an ArrayList, the indices all of the elements after that element change (decrement by 1), as the ArrayList has to fill up the hole left by the removed element.\n",
    "* The capacity of an ArrayList is different from its size in that the capacity defines the number of elements the ArrayList can store without changing the size of its internal array, while the size is the number of actual data/elements saved within the ArrayList. The capacity of an ArrayList can be manually specified, but is by default 10 elements, and will dynamically grow with the elements appended to the ArrayList (after capacity has been exceeded), but will remain constant when elements are removed from the ArrayList (unless trimToSize() method is used). The size of an ArrayList starts off at 0 if the ArrayList is initialized as empty, and will change in correspondence to elements being added to or removed from the ArrayList.\n",
    "* The classes in the Collections framework are grouped by different interfaces (e.g. The list classes such as ArrayList and LinkedList implement the List interface). It is important to note that Lists are ordered data structures, meaning each of their elements are designated a specific consecutive position/index within the List."

    "## Notes: ##\n",
    "* Like an ArrayList, a LinkedList is a linear dynamic data structure used for saving a collection of elements. However, a LinkedList stores each element as a node, as opposed to an ArrayList which stores elements in consecutive memory blocks. Each node composes of a value and two pointers (pointers require memory) to the previous and next nodes in the LinkedList. By default, LinkedLists implement a Doubly-LinkedList structure, where each node has both a previous and next pointer. But, LinkedLists can be modified to implement a Singly-LinkedList structure, where each node only has a next pointer.\n",
    "* A general rule of thumb is that when you want to add or remove elements toward the end of a List, you should use an ArrayList, but if you want to add or remove elements just about anywhere else in the List, you should use a LinkedList. This is due to the fact that adding new elements anywhere but the end of the List will cause an ArrayList to shift the positions of all the elements after the index at which the new element is added, while a LinkedList does not.\n",
    "* An ArrayList essentially organizes and manages an internal array, in which is creates a continuous memory location chain (requiring an internal array as its container) for all of its elements. Because of this, it is easy for an ArrayList to access and traverse through elements by index (can access any element in ArrayList by index in constant time because program can calculate location with index and consecutive memory locations within internal array, but for LinkedList, accessing an element by index causes the LinkedList to start at the head node, then use the next pointers of the subsequent nodes to reach the desired index), as well as add items toward the end of the List, since doing so does not really affect the indices of the other elements in the List. To add on, whenever the size of an ArrayList exceeds the capacity, the current capacity of the ArrayList will double, and the ArrayList will create a new copy of the internal array with the new element changes implemented.\n",
    "* Since a LinkedList does not store elements in consecutive memory blocks (each node could be anywhere in memory, but each node's pointers refer to the memory locations), its dynamic memory allocation helps be more efficient in cases such as adding or removing elements within the beginning and middle of the List. A standard LinkedList starts off at the head/first node, and each node within it points to the previous element and next element in the List (basically the pointers of a node refer to the memory locations of the previous and next nodes), where the head node's previous pointer refers to a null value and the last node's next pointer also refers to a null value.\n",
    "* Since a node in a LinkedList can be placed anywhere in memory, resizing operations are efficient; adding or removing an element to or from a LinkedList does not shift the positions (memory locations) of the elements around it. Adding an element to a LinkedList causes it to create a new node and insert it to the desired position in the List, then adjust the pointers of the nodes around it, and cause the new node to point to the nodes before and after it. Removing an element from a LinkedList causes it to remove the node at the desired position, then adjusting the pointers of the nodes around with the absence of teh removed element. Note that it will take some time for the LinkedList to traverse to the the desired index, but it is still efficient in that it does not need to change the positions of the other elements to accommodate for the changes."

    "* In Java, the HashMap, which is a part of the Java Collections framework, is a data structure that saves items as key-value pairs. This means that a specific element in a HashMap consists of 2 parts: a key and a value, where the key is used to access its corresponding value. HashMaps are Generics, as they ask for 2 parameterized types, one to define the data type of the keys and the other to define that of the values. Basically, think of a HashMap as a look-up table that stores key-value pairs, with every key being unique and each key giving access to a certain value. If a key-value pair is appended to a HashMap but the key already exists, the new value will replace the already-existing value in the HashMap, and the key will remain the same (you can have duplicate values, but keys must be unique).\n",
    "* Most data structures, such as ArrayLists and HashMaps which are designed to hold objects, that are a part of the Java Collections framework use auto-boxing to automatically convert primitive data into their non-primitive/object counterparts (wrapper classes. e.g. int to Integer, which happens when appending primitive variables to data structures such as ArrayList). Unboxing is the process fo converting a wrapper class into its primitive data type counterpart (e.g. Integer to int, which happens when retrieving primitive values from data structures such as ArrayList).\n",
    "* HashMap is not an ordered data structure, as its appended element order does not necessarily match its retrieved element order (the retrieved element order is not always the same every time for HashMaps, since their elements are typically retrieved by their value properties via keys, not indices). HashMaps implement a hashing function, which essentially allows them to map keys to certain indices within an internal array, giving them the ability to have fast access times when retrieving values based on keys.\n",
    "* The Map.Entry`<Key Type, Value Type>` Generic method of the Map interface is used to retrieve a specific entry/element of a HashMap into an object that stores the key and value pair. The entrySet() method of the HashMap class creates a set and returns a set-view of all of the elements/entries in the HashMap. These 2 methods are essentially used in correspondence with each other to iterate through HashMaps, allowing programmers to access a specific entry, as well as useful properties such as the entry's key and value pair. The keySet() method of the HashMap class creates a set/collection of all of the keys in the HashMap for iteration, while the values() method of the HashMap class creates a set/collection of all of the values in the HashMap for iteration. Just like HashMaps, the sets created by keySet() and values() are not ordered."

The hash table is used to store the key and value pairs, and the LinkedList is used to keep the order in which elements are appended to the LinkedHashMap. If the value of a particular key is updated, the element's index in the LinkedList stays the same, since the order of elements in the LinkedHashMap is determined by order of when each element was first appended. When elements are removed from the LinkedHashMap, they are removed from both the LinkedList and hash table.\n",
    "* The constructor of the LinkedHashMap can be used to specify to base the order of the LinkedHashMap on appended order or access order.

When a key-value pair is appended to a HashMap, the HashMap uses a hashing algorithm to determine the hash code of the key object (hence why HashMaps take non-primitive data types), then convert the hash code into an index with a hashing function to mark the key's location in the internal array (the array represents the hash table, where the index represents the hash code of the key, and the element represents the key-value pair itself). The key-value pair is then assigned to the bucket corresponding to the index in the array (reminder that primitive data are stored as actual values in an array, while object data are stored as references to their memory locations in the array), and in the case of retrieving a value from a key, the HashMap calculates the hash code of the inputted key, then uses the index representation of the hash code to find the key-value pair that matches the inputted key within the hash table. The internal array/hash table is dynamically resized using a load factor, which happens when the ratio of number of elements to the array size exceeds a certain capacity.\n",
    "* The TreeMap is special kind of HashMap that sorts its elements (by key) in natural order (or in a custom order if a custom comparator is defined by the programmer), implementing the NavigableMap interface and the SortedMap interface, which extends the Map interface. Like HashMap and LinkedHashMap, TreeMap provides sufficient methods for searching, insertion (can also update values for already-appended keys), and deletion.\n",
    "* Natural order typically means numerical and alphabetical order, and serves the basis as to how TreeMaps order the elements within it (by comparing keys). Each TreeMap has an underlying red-black binary search tree, which maintains the balanced height of the tree. The NavigableMap interfaces provides TreeMaps with further functionalities such as range-based key and value retrievals.\n",
    "* In Java, a tree is a fundamental data structure that represents a hierarchical structure of nodes. The root node is the ultimate parent of all the nodes under it, each node has zero or mode child nodes, and nodes are connected by edges (which are basically connections that link two nodes together and usually have directionality from parent node to child node)."

    "* The Set is a foundational interface that is implemented by classes such as HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet, similar to the Map interface's relationship with HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap.\n",
    "* It was mentioned before that Sets are usually unordered. However, this is only the case for the HashSet class, which can be considered the most basic/lightweight Set. LinkedHashSet, like LinkedHashMap, maintains insertion order, while TreeSet, like TreeMap, sorts elements by natural order. \n",
    "* HashSet utilizes a hash table to effectively and efficiently manage (insertion, deletion, and retrieval) the elements within it, as the hash table data structure gives HashSet a hashing function to map each element stored within it to a specific index in the internal array (which is basically the hash table).\n",
    "* The inner-workings of the hash table in the HashSet: An element added has its hash code calculated, which is then converted to an index for the internal array/hash table with a hash function. To handle internal collisions, each index in the hash table usually has a LinkedList that can store more than one element if multiple elements added have the same hash code (indicating duplicate elements. The HashSet will only use one of the elements in the LinkedList to ensure only unique elements are \"saved\" in the HashSet). Upon retrieval or removal of elements, the HashSet calculates the hash code then index for the inputted element, then traverses through the hash table using that index to find the actual element within the HashSet. \n",
    "* HashSet, like HashMap, is dynamically resizable as it increases the size of its internal array/hash table when the number of elements exceeds a certain capacity. LinkedHashSet and TreeSet have very similar inner-workings to HashSet, except they utilize additional data structures such as LinkedList (LinkedHashSet) and red-black binary search tree (TreeSet)."

    "* The equals() and hashCode() methods are both methods inherited from the Object grandparent class, and are typically overridden by the programmer to define what the programmer thinks determines equality between objects.\n",
    "* In conventionally overriding, the equals() method returns true if 2 objects are equal semantically (i.e. in terms of property values, unlike == which checks if 2 objects are literally the same object/memory location, which is the same as the default equals() method that is not overridden). When overriding the equals() method, programmer usually follow these core principles: reflexive, symmetric, transitive, consistent, and null values, which ensure that the equals() method is effective and consistent in comparing objects semantically.\n",
    "* The hashCode() method generates an almost-unique integer hash code (identifier) for a particular object, and hash codes are often used by data structures such as Maps and Sets, which utilize hash tables, during object management. Hash-based data structures calculate the hash code of an object to determine the location that object should be placed within its internal data structure(s), which includes a hash table (which is sort of like an array with indices and elements).\n",
    "* Oftentimes, when the equals() method is overridden, the hashCode() method is also overridden. This is because, with the hashCode() method being overridden the correct way, 2 objects that are considered equal semantically by the equals() method will have the same hash codes, thus effectively maintaining the important relationship between the equals() and hashCode() methods (as the hash code is an identifier of an object and its property values).\n",
    "* As hash-based data structures like Maps and Sets contain unique keys and elements, respectively, they by default cannot tell if 2 custom objects (objects of the Java default classes, like String, actually have overridden equals() methods that actually compare the contents of 2 objects) are actually equal semantically. Because of this, the equals() method should be overridden in the custom class to define what makes objects of it equal (usually defined semantically), so that these data structures can prevent duplicate custom objects (duplicate as in equal semantically) and thus maintain only distinct items. Furthermore, the hashCode() method should also be overridden, because 2 objects that are equal semantically should conventionally have the same hash codes; hash-based data structures use the hash code of objects to determine their position in the hash table, so 2 duplicate objects should have the same hash code to ensure data collisions are handled (with LinkedLists at each index to hold duplicate elements). It is important to note that hash-based data structures use both the equals() method and the hashCode() method to determine if 2 objects are distinct, as well as the different locations (in the hash table) of distinct objects."

    "* The Collections class, which is a part of the Java Collections framework, provides a variety of functionalities in the form of static methods (static methods can be called directly using dot notation with the class name, meaning you do not necessarily need to create an object of the class to call these methods). For example, the sort() method of the Collections class by default sorts Lists in ascending (least to greatest) order based on a natural ordering comparator (usually numerical and alphabetical order). The elements in the Lists need to implement the Comparable interface (Wrapper classes and Strings automatically implement it, by custom classes need to manually implement it), which is an interface that allows objects to be compared to each other. Furthermore, programmers can use the overloaded (different parameters) sort() method to define a custom comparator to replace the natural ordering comparator.\n",
    "* The Comparator Generic/template interface is implemented by classes defined by programmer as custom comparators. When the programmer does not want to compare objects on the basis of the natural ordering defined by the Comparable interface, which is implemented by the objects being compared, they create a custom class that implements the Comparator interface, which takes a parameterized type that indicates what type of data is being compared. With this custom class, the programmer can define the type of ordering the custom comparator is based on. The compare() method of the Comparator interface takes 2 object parameters of the defined parameterized type by the programmer, then returns a negative integer if the first object is less than the second object, returns 0 if both objects are considered equal, and returns a positive integer if the first object is greater than the second object.\n",
    "* With a custom comparator, objects of any class can now be sorted (like custom objects instead of wrapper classes and Strings), even their classes do not implement the Comparable interface. Custom comparators can be used in correspondence with the sort() method of the Collections class to replace the default natural ordering sorting. By default, the sort() method utilizes the natural ordering comparator provided by Comparable, but with a custom comparator, the sort() method utilizes the compare() method provided by the implemented Comparator.\n",
    "* The compareTo() method of the Comparable interface compares 2 objects based on natural ordering, and returns a negative integer if the first object (the one the method is called on) is less than the second object (the one passed as an argument), 0 if both objects are equal, and a positive integer if the first object is greater than the second object. It basically follows the same logic as the compare() method from the Comparator interface.\n",
    "* To sort in descending (greatest to least) order for a custom comparator, just reverse the usual (usual as in ascending) sign of the return value(s), meaning if the first object is less than the second object, return a positive integer, if they are equal, return 0, and if the first object is greater than the second object, return a negative integer."

As such, it provides fundamental operations for these diverse data structures such as adding, removing, querying (e.g. check if empty), updating, and iterating. The Collection interface has a variety of sub-interfaces (interface inheritance) such as List, Set, and Queue, which each define more specifically the characteristics and inner-workings of the data structures that fall under them.\n",

Once a custom class effectively implements the compareTo() (ascending: return negative integer (current object is sorted to an earlier position in the data structure) if current object is less than specified argument object, return 0 (both objects are next to each other) if both objects are equal, and return a positive integer (current object is sorted to a later position) if the current object is greater than the specified argument object. descending: reverse the signs of the integer returned) method of Comparable, its custom objects can then be sorted in custom natural order within key data structures of the Java Collections framework."

    "## Notes: ##\n",
    "* In Java, the Queue is a Generic Java Collections framework data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) ordering principle (establishes how elements in a data structure are ordered and managed), meaning that the first element appended to a Queue will be the first element to be removed from the Queue. A real-life example of a Queue would be like a line of people purchasing tickets, where it is essentially first-come-first-serve.\n",
    "* The front of a Queue is known as the head, while the back of a Queue is known as the tail. Elements are removed from the head of the Queue (Enqueue), and elements are appended to the back of the Queue (Dequeue).\n",
    "* The Queue interface is implemented by numerous classes, including LinkedList, ArrayDeque, and PriorityQueue, which each have a slightly different implementation of Queue, with LinkedList being the most standard implementation. Queues are oftentimes used to accomplish tasks such as handling multi-threaded environments and dealing with asynchronous programming.\n",
    "* The inner-workings of a LinkedList-based Queue involves an internal LinkedList (each node has data and next node pointer), where the head of the Queue points to the first node in the LinkedList, and the tail of the Queue points to the last node in the LinkedList. The Enqueue operation will append a new node to the end of the LinkedList, while the Dequeue operation will remove the node at the front of the LinkedList. \n",
    "* Lists like LinkedList and ArrayList are dynamically resizable data structures, meaning that LinkedList-based Queues typically do not have a maximum item capacity. However, this isn't the case of the ArrayBlockingQueue class (implements BlockingQueue interface, which extends Queue interface), which a part of the java.util.concurrent package of the Java Collections framework.\n",
    "* BlockingQueues provide blocking/waiting operations when the Queue is full or empty (e.g. one thread will enqueue elements, a separate thread will dequeue elements, and both threads will depend on each other in the case of blocking), allowing for multiple threads (a thread is a sequence of code instructions that is to be executed by the CPU, while a process is an independent instance of a program's execution, containing memory space, system resources, and a thread(s). A process can contain multiple threads, which enables the ability for the program to multi-task and share resources amongst threads) to effectively communicate and synchronize properly. \n",
    "* ArrayBlockingQueue contains an internal array, and is initialized with a specified fixed size capacity (maximum size of the Queue), meaning when it is full, any further enqueued elements will need to be blocked until space becomes available again, and when it is empty, any further dequeued elements will need to be blocked until an element becomes available. Because of this, it provides blocking versions of Enqueue and Dequeue operations (will need to initialize with variable type BlockingQueue interface, so that ArrayBlockingQueue can implement the methods specific to BlockingQueue but not Queue interface), which are utilized when the ArrayBlockingQueue is empty or full and in a multi-thread environment. Not only that, ArrayBlockingQueue is thread-safe, in that it works well in allowing concurrent access in a multi-thread environment (e.g. one thread adds elements to Queue, while another thread removes elements to Queue concurrently, and the special Enqueue and Dequeue operations provided by the BlockingQueue interface make it easier for these threads to synchronize together), and thus effective synchronization amongst multiple threads."
