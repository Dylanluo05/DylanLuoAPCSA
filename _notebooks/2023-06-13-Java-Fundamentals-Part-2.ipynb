    "* Packages in Java allow you to organize your code in a way that helps you find necessary files/classes quickly. They also assist in preventing conflicts in class names (e.g. 2 classes with the same name will not conflict if they are in separate packages).\n",
    "* The naming convention of package names is typically lowercase, with no spaces nor underscores (package names are usually concise).\n",
    "* Use the package keyword the specify the package a file is a part of, and use the import keyword to be able to implement that file from a separate file/class. The * keyword in an import statement indicates that all of the files/classes of the package will be imported.\n",
    "* Packages in Java follow a hierarchy, which means that you can have packages within packages. Slashes (/) are used to indicate/separate sub-folders, while dots (.) are used to indicate/separate sub-packages.\n",
    "* Package names should be unique in the whole world, so that code can be redistributed effectively without any conflicts. The naming convention of unique package names is first putting either your name (full name) or reversing the name (order of words) of your organization's website, then putting the sub-package name that indicates the purpose of your package."

    "* In Java, interfaces are implicitly abstract (you do not need to declare them with the abstract keyword), and the methods within them are in turn implicitly public and abstract (but can still be custom defined). Interfaces do not contain code that perform actions, but rather the headers of defined methods and sometimes attributes (which are usually public, static, and final).\n",
    "* Interfaces are ultimately used to achieve abstraction, where they group related methods that all have empty bodies. Interfaces are accessed with the \"implement\" keyword from another class, and that class defines the bodies of the interface methods, thus overriding (redefining the method to have a body but with the same exact name and signature/headers) the interface method. Distinct classes can define a particular interface's methods differently. However, attributes can be declared and have their values defined in interfaces, and child classes will inherit the values defined in interfaces, or re-define the variables again (making sure to keep the same modifiers and variable name).\n",
    "* Similar to abstract classes, interfaces cannot be used to initialize objects (where the interface name follows the new keyword), and do not have \"bodies\" of code. An interface is implemented by separate classes, in which all of the methods defined in the interface must be overridden with method bodies of code defined in the class. It is important to note that a class can implement multiple interfaces (in contrast, a class can only extend one parent class), and an interface can be implemented by multiple classes (a parent class can be inherited by multiple child classes).\n"

    "* When referencing an attribute or method of a particular class within that class itself, you do not need to prefix the variable name. In other words, notation like objectName.variableName is unnecessary, since variableName works by itself. This means that the access modifier does not matter; as long as you are referencing the variable within the same class, you can directly access it by name or optionally prefix dot notation.\n",
    "* Just for review, you typically should have one (and only one) public class in a file, and that public class's name should match the name of the file. However, you can have as many non-public classes with different names in the file as you want.\n",
    "* Access modifiers define the access level of attributes, methods, classes, and constructors, while non-access modifiers do not define the access level, but rather other forms of functionality.\n",
    "* Encapsulation is typically used to keep certain attributes or methods of a class hidden/private from the rest of the world, for the purpose of controlling the way people access these variables, and preventing unnecessary changes from happening to them. \n",

    "* Polymorphism, which means \"many shapes/forms\", involves the process of creating multiple classes that related to each other in some way through the inheritance of a super class. It is efficient in allowing code reusability amongst different classes. Polymorphism also states that an object of a sub-class can also have the variable type of the super-class (i.e. SuperClass variableName = new SubClass()). \n",
    "* However, it is important to note that the initialized variable type of an object variable defines the attributes and methods the variable has access to (can only access those listed in the class of the variable type), while the initialized object type of the variable defines the values of its attributes and the actions of its methods (the values and code defined in the class of the object type).\n",
    "* As inheritance allows different sub-classes to inherit the attributes and methods of a super class, polymorphism gives us the ability to take those attributes and methods and perform different kinds of tasks amongst different sub-classes that are each somewhat related to each other. Polymorphism basically gives sub-classes the ability to override the attributes and methods defined in the super-class.\n",

This prevents direct access to certain attributes or methods of the class, restricting users from directly accessing the state values of those variables. The state/inner values and actions of encapsulated attributes and methods are usually intended to only be directly used within the class (they are typically indirectly used outside the class). Encapsulation is also useful for preventing conflicts in variables amongst different classes. A state value of a variable refers to its instantaneous value during any point of the program's execution.\n",

The getter method allows users to read values of encapsulated variables, while the setter method allows users to change values of encapsulated variables, all-the-while the inner-workings of the class are modified but hidden away from the public for privacy and security. Getters and setters allow encapsulated attributes and methods to be applied toward external purposes outside of the class.\n",

Type casting can be used for primitive variable types (note that special types of conversion methods different from type casting are used to convert from primitive to non-primitive types and vice versa. Basically, reference/non-primitive types use unique conversion methods rather than type casting), and during its process, data is not changed, but rather the data type, allowing us to see different kinds of conversions amongst different data types. \n",
    "* Widening casting involves converting a smaller data type to larger data type size, in which the type casting is done automatically by the program (changes are not necessarily major for the value being casted). Narrowing casting involves converting a larger data type to a smaller data type size, in which the type casting is done manually by the programmer (changes may be major for the value being casted).\n",

Generic entities operate on a parameterized type(s), which specify the type of data they will work with (i.e. the types of objects they can store and retrieve for the programmer) when instantiated as methods or objects. Generics are able to provide templates for certain classes in a sense. Generic classes are used to create useful data structures in Java such as ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, HashMap, etc.\n",
    "* A Generic method, working just like a normal method, takes a \"type\" parameter(s) that specifies the type of data that should be passed into the method (usually in between the diamond brackets <>), enabling a general usage of the method.\n",
    "* A Generic class, working just like a normal class, takes a \"type\" parameter(s) in a certain section of its definition (usually in between the diamond brackets <>), which specifies the type of data the object of the class works with in general.\n",
    "* As Generics follow a parameterized type(s), they eliminate the need for programmers to perform redundant type castings (Programmers used to have to type cast the data retrieved from certain data structure classes in order to convert from unwanted object to desired variable type. Now, Generics will return data of the appropriate type). So, for a Generic entity to be Generic, it needs to have one or more type parameters. Parameterized types basically allow Generics to hold and work with (e.g. add, remove, retrieve) a general range of data that fit within the specified data type(s), in turn allowing for type-safety during compile time.\n",
    "* It is important to note that when defining parameterized types within the <> of a Generic entity, they need to be specified as objects. This means that primitive types need to be specified in their wrapper class forms (e.g. int - Integer). A parameterized type can also be specified as an object (referred by the class name) of a custom class that you created. You can also have nested parameterized types, where the outer parameterized type represents some kind of list which has its own parameterized data type (e.g. type parameter is ArrayList).\n",
    "* Wrapper classes are basically classes that represent equivalent primitive type counterparts. For example, the wrapper class of int is Integer, and the wrapper class of char is Character. Wrapper classes are essentially the reference/object equivalents to primitive types, and should be defined with Generics in Java's Collection framework."

    "* In Java, an exception is essentially an event during a program's execution in which an error occurs in the flow of the code, leading to the program's disruption and possible stoppage, and sometimes prompting the program to create an object (exceptions are actually objects of a class called Exception) detailing the exception and sending it to the runtime.\n",
    "* The throws keyword is defined in a method signature/declaration, and determines which kind of exception (should usually be only one) should be thrown from the method, ultimately defining the certain kind of error the program should handle if it occurs. Generally, we should use throws to handle checked exceptions, since unchecked exceptions do not need to be manually handled as they are automatically caught by runtime. Throwing an exception means creating an object for the exception, then throwing it to the runtime to display. The message presented by the runtime about the exception is known as the stack trace.\n",
    "* In Java, the try catch statement provides a way of handling exceptions in the program. The code block within the try statement define the code that the program will test for errors. The moment a line of code within the try statement has an error, the try statement immediately throws an exception to the catch statement. \n",
    "* The exception is essentially caught by the catch statement (parameter of catch statement defines which kind of exceptions it should look for. e.g. FileNoteFoundException e, where e is the object variable to store the FileNoteFoundException; Exception e, where e is the object variable to store any kind of exceptions, as indicated by the general name Exception), and the code block within the catch statement defines the action that will be taken if an error is found within the try statement.\n",
    "* Following the try catch statement you can optionally write a finally statement, and the code block in the finally statement defines the actions that will be taken after the try catch statement regardless of the result. The useful aspect of try catch is that the program will still run even if errors are found in the try statement (since the exception thrown by try is caught by catch and handled, instead of thrown to runtime). However, exceptions found in the catch statement or finally statement will be thrown to runtime.\n",
    "* Sometimes, methods will call each other, which means that multiple methods could encounter the same exception. This means that good practice is that each method should have a way (throw or try catch) to handle the exception. Any exceptions that may be thrown that may be encountered anywhere else in the program should be handled in some way (either thrown again or caught again)."

    "* In Java, a method can be modified to be able to handle multiple exceptions, defined in the method signature and separated by commas.

The throw new command allows us to manually throw an object of the Exception class during the program, also enabling us to define a custom error message in the constructor of the object (different exception classes may have different constructor parameters). The throw keyword stops the running of the program.\n",
    "* The throws keyword, which is defined with exceptions separated commas in the method signature, helps us define a list of potential exceptions that may occur in a method. We can use try catch statements to choose how to handle each kind of exception (each catch statement parameter takes a specific type of exception, and the code block within the catch statement can take custom action with the program still running, or throw the appropriate exception to stop the running of the program).\n",

Child exceptions should always be checked before parent exceptions, since parent exceptions always (encapsulate) catch errors of child exceptions, but child exceptions cannot catch errors from the other children of parent exceptions. If a parent exception checker were to be placed before the child exception checker, the child exception would never be reached, because it would be handled by the parent exception checker."

The normal attributes and methods of an abstract class can have values and bodies, though they can only be accessed through a child class that extends the abstract class (note that private instance variables of a parent class can be accessed/inherited by a separate/child class if that instance variable has public getters and setters).\n",
    "* Abstract methods defined in an abstract class should be coupled with the abstract keyword and have no body, but should not have the abstract modifier and should have a body when re-defined in child classes. Normal attributes and methods defined in either the abstract class or the child classes should not have the abstract keyword, and their values and bodies can be defined in both the abstract class and child classes.\n",
    "* The main difference in purpose between abstract classes and interfaces is that abstract classes are not intended to create objects from, as they serve to provide common functionality (sort of like a base parent class) to child classes that are related to each other (we want to create objects of these child classes), while interfaces serve to provide common functionality to child classes that are not necessarily related to each other. For example an abstract class Animal can be extended to child classes Pig and Cow (class hierarchy), which are related, while an interface showInfo can be implemented by child classes Machine and Person, which are not that related.\n",
    "* A class can implement multiple interfaces, but can only have one parent class (although it could technically inherit from the parent class of its parent class). In an interface you should have no implementation of methods (no bodies defined), but in an abstract class you can have implementation of methods (bodies defined for conventional methods but not abstract methods)."

    "* The built-in AutoCloseable interface of Java indicates that a class implementing it should have some adequate form of the close() method. \n",

The notation is mostly the same, except the try statement can now take parameters/clauses, and within the parameters/clauses, you can declare the resources (or objects that work with resources) that the try statement will check and work with. Resources may include files or sockets, which are opened when they are accessed, and should be closed to prevent memory leaks. \n",
    "* The catch statement in the try-with-resources serves basically the same purpose, handling any exceptions that may be thrown during the running of the try statement, or any exceptions thrown while working with or closing the resource(s), and the finally statement will run no matter the outcome of the try and catch statements.\n",
    "* Objects of classes that implement AutoCloseable, which are declared within try-with-resources, will automatically call the close() method after finishing performing all of its called actions. If any errors are met before the close() method (in the try statement), the try-with-resources will call the catch statement, and the rest of the try statement will not be executed (known as try exception). However, the catch statement will check again for the close() method, which is ran at the very end of the try-with-resources (known as try-with-resources exception, which may become a suppressed exception if a try exception is met before the same try-with-resources statement.
