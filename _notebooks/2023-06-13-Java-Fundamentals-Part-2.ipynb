    "* Packages in Java allow you to organize your code in a way that helps you find necessary files/classes quickly. They also assist in preventing conflicts in class names (e.g. 2 classes with the same name will not conflict if they are in separate packages).\n",
    "* The naming convention of package names is typically lowercase, with no spaces nor underscores (package names are usually concise).\n",
    "* Use the package keyword the specify the package a file is a part of, and use the import keyword to be able to implement that file from a separate file/class. The * keyword in an import statement indicates that all of the files/classes of the package will be imported.\n",
    "* Packages in Java follow a hierarchy, which means that you can have packages within packages. Slashes (/) are used to indicate/separate sub-folders, while dots (.) are used to indicate/separate sub-packages.\n",
    "* Package names should be unique in the whole world, so that code can be redistributed effectively without any conflicts. The naming convention of unique package names is first putting either your name (full name) or reversing the name (order of words) of your organization's website, then putting the sub-package name that indicates the purpose of your package."

    "* In Java, interfaces are implicitly abstract (you do not need to declare them with the abstract keyword), and the methods within them are in turn implicitly public and abstract (but can still be custom defined). Interfaces do not contain code that perform actions, but rather the headers of defined methods and sometimes attributes (which are usually public, static, and final).\n",
    "* Interfaces are ultimately used to achieve abstraction, where they group related methods that all have empty bodies. Interfaces are accessed with the \"implement\" keyword from another class, and that class defines the bodies of the interface methods, thus overriding (redefining the method to have a body but with the same exact name and signature/headers) the interface method. Distinct classes can define a particular interface's methods differently. However, attributes can be declared and have their values defined in interfaces, and child classes will inherit the values defined in interfaces, or re-define the variables again (making sure to keep the same modifiers and variable name).\n",
    "* Similar to abstract classes, interfaces cannot be used to initialize objects (where the interface name follows the new keyword), and do not have \"bodies\" of code. An interface is implemented by separate classes, in which all of the methods defined in the interface must be overridden with method bodies of code defined in the class. It is important to note that a class can implement multiple interfaces (in contrast, a class can only extend one parent class), and an interface can be implemented by multiple classes (a parent class can be inherited by multiple child classes).\n"

    "* When referencing an attribute or method of a particular class within that class itself, you do not need to prefix the variable name. In other words, notation like objectName.variableName is unnecessary, since variableName works by itself. This means that the access modifier does not matter; as long as you are referencing the variable within the same class, you can directly access it by name or optionally prefix dot notation.\n",
    "* Just for review, you typically should have one (and only one) public class in a file, and that public class's name should match the name of the file. However, you can have as many non-public classes with different names in the file as you want.\n",
    "* Access modifiers define the access level of attributes, methods, classes, and constructors, while non-access modifiers do not define the access level, but rather other forms of functionality.\n",
    "* Encapsulation is typically used to keep certain attributes or methods of a class hidden/private from the rest of the world, for the purpose of controlling the way people access these variables, and preventing unnecessary changes from happening to them. \n",
    "* Usually when we declare a particular variable public, that variable is defined as static and/or final, which means it belongs and remains constant (or has a constant change if final is not declared) to the class itself, so that it is relatively unchangeable by others.\n",
    "* The order in which modifiers appear does not necessarily matter all of the time, but there is a recommended order.\n",
    "* The public access modifier defines a class, attribute, method, or constructor as directly accessible to all other classes.\n",
    "* The private access modifier defines an attribute, method, or constructor as only directly accessible within the class it is declared in (can be accessed with getter methods from other classes though). Private variables are not inherited by child classes.\n",
    "* The protected access modifier defines an attribute, method, or constructor as only accessible within the same package (implies same file too) and any subsequent subclasses (even subclasses in separate packages, unlike the default access modifier) of the class it is declared in. This means that protected variables are inherited by child classes.\n",
    "* The default access modifier (happens when no access modifier is declared at all) defines a class, attribute, method, or constructor as only accessible by other classes in the same package (implies same file too). A child class can inherit default access modified variables from the parent class only if it is in the same package. It is possible for a child class to extend a parent class in another package using the import feature, but in that case, default variables are not inherited."

    "* However, it is important to note that the initialized variable type of an object variable defines the attributes and methods the variable has access to (can only access those listed in the class of the variable type), while the initialized object type of the variable defines the values of its attributes and the actions of its methods (the values and code defined in the class of the object type).\n",
    "* As inheritance allows different sub-classes to inherit the attributes and methods of a super class, polymorphism gives us the ability to take those attributes and methods and perform different kinds of tasks amongst different sub-classes that are each somewhat related to each other. Polymorphism basically gives sub-classes the ability to override the attributes and methods defined in the super-class.\n",
    "* Example: The Animal super-class, which has a sound() method, is inherited by the Pig, Cat, and Dog sub-classes. Pig, Cat, and Dog, will each have their own unique implementation/override of the inherited sound() method."

    "* The purpose of encapsulation (Using access modifiers like private or protected) is primarily to purposely hide some of the inner-workings/elements of a particular class from the public. This prevents direct access to certain attributes or methods of the class, restricting users from directly accessing the state values of those variables. The state/inner values and actions of encapsulated attributes and methods are usually intended to only be directly used within the class (they are typically indirectly used outside the class). Encapsulation is also useful for preventing conflicts in variables amongst different classes. A state value of a variable refers to its instantaneous value during any point of the program's execution.\n",
    "* Encapsulated variables are typically accessed outside the class with getter and setter methods for those specific variables. The getter method allows users to read values of encapsulated variables, while the setter method allows users to change values of encapsulated variables, all-the-while the inner-workings of the class are modified but hidden away from the public for privacy and security. Getters and setters allow encapsulated attributes and methods to be applied toward external purposes outside of the class.\n",

Type casting can be used for primitive variable types (note that special types of conversion methods different from type casting are used to convert from primitive to non-primitive types and vice versa. Basically, reference/non-primitive types use unique conversion methods rather than type casting), and during its process, data is not changed, but rather the data type, allowing us to see different kinds of conversions amongst different data types. \n",

Generics are able to provide templates for certain classes in a sense. Generic classes are used to create useful data structures in Java such as ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, HashMap, etc.\n",

    "* A Generic class, working just like a normal class, takes a \"type\" parameter(s) in a certain section of its definition (usually in between the diamond brackets <>), which specifies the type of data the object of the class works with in general.\n",
    "* As Generics follow a parameterized type(s), they eliminate the need for programmers to perform redundant type castings (Programmers used to have to type cast the data retrieved from certain data structure classes in order to convert from unwanted object to desired variable type. Now, Generics will return data of the appropriate type). So, for a Generic entity to be Generic, it needs to have one or more type parameters. Parameterized types basically allow Generics to hold and work with (e.g. add, remove, retrieve) a general range of data that fit within the specified data type(s), in turn allowing for type-safety during compile time.\n",
    "* It is important to note that when defining parameterized types within the <> of a Generic entity, they need to be specified as objects. This means that primitive types need to be specified in their wrapper class forms (e.g. int - Integer). A parameterized type can also be specified as an object (referred by the class name) of a custom class that you created. You can also have nested parameterized types, where the outer parameterized type represents some kind of list which has its own parameterized data type (e.g. type parameter is ArrayList).\n",
    "* Wrapper classes are basically classes that represent equivalent primitive type counterparts. For example, the wrapper class of int is Integer, and the wrapper class of char is Character. Wrapper classes are essentially the reference/object equivalents to primitive types, and should be defined with Generics in Java's Collection framework."

    "* Normally, a Generic entity such as ArrayList with a parameterized type object of a child class is NOT a subclass of a Generic entity with a parameterized type object of a parent class.\n",

Wildcard Generics are declared in the parameters of methods. Because of this, the type of variable(s) the Generic entity in the method parameter ultimately works with is typically specified as an argument during the passing of another Generic (which itself has a specified type parameter) to the method. \n",
    "* Keep in mind that after the parameterized type of a wildcard Generic has been determined with the argument passed, the parameterized type needs to remain consistent (e.g. An ArrayList of type parameter String was passed as an argument for the ArrayList parameter with a wildcard type parameter. In the method, the ArrayList parameter will now be treated as an ArrayList with type parameter String). A wildcard is basically a special kind of type parameter that essentially dictates the type safety of Generics on a broader scale.\n",
    "* Upper bounds and lower bounds of wildcards cannot be specified at the same time. The lower bound of a wildcard indicates that the unknown type is limited to the specified class type, or any super class of the specified class type.

If multiple different data types were to be on the same line, the program can (but does not necessarily need to; could for example use nextInt() to read only the integer and use nextLine() to read the remaining content on the line) read the whole line as a String, concatenating all of the different data types into a single content.\n",

    "* In Java, an exception is essentially an event during a program's execution in which an error occurs in the flow of the code, leading to the program's disruption and possible stoppage, and sometimes prompting the program to create an object (exceptions are actually objects of a class called Exception) detailing the exception and sending it to the runtime.\n",
    "* The throws keyword is defined in a method signature/declaration, and determines which kind of exception (should usually be only one) should be thrown from the method, ultimately defining the certain kind of error the program should handle if it occurs. Generally, we should use throws to handle checked exceptions, since unchecked exceptions do not need to be manually handled as they are automatically caught by runtime. Throwing an exception means creating an object for the exception, then throwing it to the runtime to display. The message presented by the runtime about the exception is known as the stack trace.\n",
    "* In Java, the try catch statement provides a way of handling exceptions in the program. The code block within the try statement define the code that the program will test for errors. The moment a line of code within the try statement has an error, the try statement immediately throws an exception to the catch statement. \n",
    "* The exception is essentially caught by the catch statement (parameter of catch statement defines which kind of exceptions it should look for. e.g. FileNoteFoundException e, where e is the object variable to store the FileNoteFoundException; Exception e, where e is the object variable to store any kind of exceptions, as indicated by the general name Exception), and the code block within the catch statement defines the action that will be taken if an error is found within the try statement.\n",
    "* Following the try catch statement you can optionally write a finally statement, and the code block in the finally statement defines the actions that will be taken after the try catch statement regardless of the result. The useful aspect of try catch is that the program will still run even if errors are found in the try statement (since the exception thrown by try is caught by catch and handled, instead of thrown to runtime). However, exceptions found in the catch statement or finally statement will be thrown to runtime.\n",
    "* Sometimes, methods will call each other, which means that multiple methods could encounter the same exception. This means that good practice is that each method should have a way (throw or try catch) to handle the exception. Any exceptions that may be thrown that may be encountered anywhere else in the program should be handled in some way (either thrown again or caught again)."

    "* In Java, a method can be modified to be able to handle multiple exceptions, defined in the method signature and separated by commas. The thing is that the method can only throw one exception, but it has the potential to handle any of the exceptions defined, and the exception that is handled depends on the order in which the exceptions occur (whichever occurs first is handled first).\n",
    "* The throw keyword allows us to explicitly cause the program to throw a type of exception (checked or unchecked) from a block of code. The throw new command allows us to manually throw an object of the Exception class during the program, also enabling us to define a custom error message in the constructor of the object (different exception classes may have different constructor parameters). The throw keyword stops the running of the program.\n",
    "* The throws keyword, which is defined with exceptions separated commas in the method signature, helps us define a list of potential exceptions that may occur in a method. We can use try catch statements to choose how to handle each kind of exception (each catch statement parameter takes a specific type of exception, and the code block within the catch statement can take custom action with the program still running, or throw the appropriate exception to stop the running of the program).\n",
    "* In a try multi-catch statement, one catch statement typically lists multiple different exceptions that could occur, separated by |, and defines what action should be taken if any of those exceptions occur.\n",
    "* The classes that represent each kind of exception are all sub-classes of the Exception parent class. This means the Exception class can encapsulate any kind of exception that could occur. Child exceptions should always be checked before parent exceptions, since parent exceptions always (encapsulate) catch errors of child exceptions, but child exceptions cannot catch errors from the other children of parent exceptions. If a parent exception checker were to be placed before the child exception checker, the child exception would never be reached, because it would be handled by the parent exception checker."

    "* In Java, abstraction is essentially hiding certain details about attributes and methods, and only providing essential information to users.\n",
    "* Abstract is a non-access modifier, and can be used on classes and methods. An abstract class basically serves as a base class, which is restricted in that it cannot be used to create objects. To set and get the actual values and bodies of the attributes and methods of an abstract class, it must be inherited by the child class, in which the values are actually established and accessed.\n",
    "* An abstract class can contain attributes, methods, and abstract methods. An abstract method can only be defined within an abstract class, and does not have a body, which means the action it does (its body) can only defined in a child class that inherits the abstract class. The normal attributes and methods of an abstract class can have values and bodies, though they can only be accessed through a child class that extends the abstract class (note that private instance variables of a parent class can be accessed/inherited by a separate/child class if that instance variable has public getters and setters).\n",
    "* Abstract methods defined in an abstract class should be coupled with the abstract keyword and have no body, but should not have the abstract modifier and should have a body when re-defined in child classes. Normal attributes and methods defined in either the abstract class or the child classes should not have the abstract keyword, and their values and bodies can be defined in both the abstract class and child classes.\n",
    "* The main difference in purpose between abstract classes and interfaces is that abstract classes are not intended to create objects from, as they serve to provide common functionality (sort of like a base parent class) to child classes that are related to each other (we want to create objects of these child classes), while interfaces serve to provide common functionality to child classes that are not necessarily related to each other. For example an abstract class Animal can be extended to child classes Pig and Cow (class hierarchy), which are related, while an interface showInfo can be implemented by child classes Machine and Person, which are not that related.\n",
    "* A class can implement multiple interfaces, but can only have one parent class (although it could technically inherit from the parent class of its parent class). In an interface you should have no implementation of methods (no bodies defined), but in an abstract class you can have implementation of methods (bodies defined for conventional methods but not abstract methods)."

    "* The built-in AutoCloseable interface of Java indicates that a class implementing it should have some adequate form of the close() method. \n",

The notation is mostly the same, except the try statement can now take parameters/clauses, and within the parameters/clauses, you can declare the resources (or objects that work with resources) that the try statement will check and work with. Resources may include files or sockets, which are opened when they are accessed, and should be closed to prevent memory leaks. \n",

    "* Objects of classes that implement AutoCloseable, which are declared within try-with-resources, will automatically call the close() method after finishing performing all of its called actions. If any errors are met before the close() method (in the try statement), the try-with-resources will call the catch statement, and the rest of the try statement will not be executed (known as try exception). However, the catch statement will check again for the close() method, which is ran at the very end of the try-with-resources (known as try-with-resources exception, which may become a suppressed exception if a try exception is met before the same try-with-resources statement. A suppressed exception is basically one that is thrown but somehow is ignored, and mainly appears within try, catch, and finally statements)."

The equals method is typically overridden in classes to define how objects of that class should be compared, in terms of which attributes or other kinds of properties should be checked.\n",
    "* A general rule of thumb is that when checking for equality semantically, use == for comparing primitive types, and equals() for comparing non-primitive (object) types.\n",
    "* The String class, like all other classes, inherits the Object class, and has its own implementation of the equals() method. The equals() method for Strings compares the contents of 2 String, are returns true if the characters in both Strings are all the same (also same order and same number of characters), and false otherwise.\n",
    "* In Java, the default toString() method of the Object class outputs a string representation of a particular object, which comprises the package and class name, as well as the hexadecimal memory location. The toString() method is automatically called when any value is printed to the Java console, and can be explicitly called on objects. A hash code is usually a unique integer value that is assigned to all created objects (generated by defined hashing algorithm. 2 objects can have the same hash code if generally they have equal properties and are of the same class (satisfying conditions of equals() method)), and a hash code of a particular object can be retrieved using the default hashCode() method. It is important to note that objects that are deemed equal by the equals() method have the same hash code, since the properties checked in the equals() method are also used in the hashing algorithm of the hashCode() method. equals() and hashCode() usually both need to be overridden in a particular class."

    "* In Java, an inner class is a class that is nested inside another class (or sometimes interface). Inner classes serve to group related classes together, allowing them to collectively function as a whole for the outer class.\n",
    "* While outer classes can only be declared as public or as the default access modifier, inner classes can be declared as public, private, protected, or default, allowing them to have the properties of the just mentioned access modifiers (e.g. private inner classes are only accessible within the outer class, and protected inner classes are only accessible within the same package of the outer class or any subclasses, similar to attributes and methods).\n",
    "* Outside classes cannot be static, but inner classes can. Static inner classes, similar to static attributes and methods, belong to the outer class itself (there is only one copy of it for the class and its subsequent objects), which means that a static inner class can be accessed without instantiating the outer class first (i.e. objects of a non-static inner class can only be created after an object of the outer class has been instantiated, but objects of a static inner class can be created without first creating an object for the outer class). A static inner class can have both static and non-static members (e.g. attributes, methods, but not constructors), but cannot directly access the instance (non-static) variables of the outer class (an object of the outer class would need to be created). A non-static inner class however, can have both static and non-static members, and can also directly access both static and non-static variables of the outer class.\n",

    "* In Java, an enum is a special kind of class that contains a group of constant values (implicitly static and final). Enum stands for enumeration, which in turn means \"specifically listed.\" Like attributes of a class, constant values of an enum can be accessed with the dot syntax, and the value name of a constant inside an enum is conventionally all upper case. Enum values have essentially their own data type (they are NOT Strings), and are represented by objects names similar to that of variable names; enum values are data type safe, as they are actually objects of the enum type they are declared within.\n",
    "* An enum type in Java is primarily used for storing a fixed group of already-defined constant values, which usually all have a common relation. An example of an enum set includes the days of the week, and the values of enums are typically checked with a switch statement. Enum values cannot be changed once the enum has been declared. An enum variable has the variable type of the enum type, can be used to store a particular enum value/object, and can subsequently access attributes and methods of that enum value using the dot notation.\n",
    "* An enum type can contain a constructor or multiple constructors, which can be used to initialize the instance data of an enum object. Since enum values are essentially objects of the enum type, when the list of enum values are declared within the enum, appropriate arguments must be passed for each of them (if the constructor(s) has parameters). An enum type/class can have attributes and methods like a normal class, which can be accessed with the dot notation on enum variables or enum values declared outside of the enum type (getters and setters needed for private variables), or directly from inside the enum type. All enum types have a values() method, which returns an array of all of the enum values/objects."

    "* Recursion is essentially the technique of commanding a method to call itself repeatedly until a halting/base condition is met (like a loop). Often times the halting condition checks the value of a particular variable(s), which is usually changed each time method calls itself, and often belongs to the parameter variable passed into the method. The primary purpose of recursive functions is too break complicated problems into simpler problems which can be solved more easily.\n",
    "* Stack memory is mostly used to store local variables and method calls (e.g. order of method execution), while heap memory is mostly used to store objects of classes, utilizing dynamic (allocating memory during runtime) memory allocation and de-allocation. A StackOverflowError can occur if a method calls itself in an infinite recursive loop.\n",
    "* A factorial integer is the product of an integer and all of the integers below it (e.g. 3! = 1 * 2 * 3 = 6).\n",
    "* Basically, the first call to a non-void recursive function will start a chain of return values, and each subsequent recursive call will become a part of the base return chain, as the return statement of a recursive call will usually perform some sort of operation on the original base return chain, then return a call of the recursive method again with some variables (typically parameters) changed, and connect that recursive call with the base return chain with the operation specified by the return statement (e.g. halting condition is value == 1, and return 1 when that happens --> return calculate(value - 1) * value --> calculate(3) --> return calculate(2) * 3 --> return calculate(1) * 2 * 3 --> return 1 * 2 * 3 --> return 6). Once the halting condition has been reached, the recursive method will return a value that is usually combined with the rest of the return chain, stopping the calling of the method altogether, and computing and returning the final return value from the whole base return chain and its values (which can be visualized by a recursive tree).\n",
    "* For void recursive functions, the function will repeatedly call itself (without actually returning the calls) until the base condition has been met, in which case it will just return (returns no value, or void), putting a stop to the recursive calls. In each iteration, the program will perform some sort of action, allowing the recursive method to be one step closer to the halting condition. The halting/base condition is essential for the program to run effectively, as it prevents stack overflow, and allows the recursive method to actually stop calling itself.\n",

    "## Notes: ##\n",
    "* Serialization is essentially the process of converting an object state (object's data) into a byte stream and saving that to a database, file, or over a network, while de-serialization is the process of converting an object byte stream into an actual object whose properties can be accessed in the program. Primitive types can also go through the same process of serialization and de-serialization.\n",
    "* Normally the file read program and file write program belong to the same program, and take on the forms of the open (read) and save (write) functions.\n",
    "* In Java, it is normal to have more than one main() method, as it allows the programming to have multiple entry points to their program, with each entry point serving a different purpose (e.g. run main function, test specific area of code, etc.).\n",
    "* Streaming in Java is basically sending an unchangeable, ordered sequence of elements, usually objects, to a specified location. We can perform different kinds of operations on sent streams (e.g. serializing, reading, writing, etc.).\n",
    "* The FileOutputStream class is primary used for writing data byte streams to a file, focusing on primitive data types like int, while FileWriter is used to write data byte streams for character-oriented data.\n",
    "* The ObjectOutputStream class essentially serializes Java objects into data byte streams, which are marked with the class name and object properties. These converted object data streams can be written to files and transferred over networks.\n",
    "* FileOutputStream and ObjectOutputStream both follow sequential file writing, meaning that the lines of data written into their files are done so by an ordered sequence of code between the opening and closing of the file.\n",
    "* In Java, to make objects of a class serializable, the class needs to implement the Serializable interface of the java.io package. The Serializable interface doesn't have any methods to implement, as it only really identifies classes that implement it as serializable.\n",
    "* Just to review, byte streams are used for the input and output of 8-bit byte data. Byte streams are sent to the program to be read from an input stream, and are sent to a file or database when written from an output stream, and they contain raw binary data (string of bits) which can be converted to multiple different data types.\n",
    "* FileInputStream is primarily used to reading raw byte data streams (such as image data or object data) from files to the program, while FileReader is more useful for reading character-oriented data. ObjectInputStream is used for de-serializing and reading object data previously written by ObjectOutputStream, converting the object data back into their corresponding objects to be accessed by the program.\n",
    "* It is important to note again that each time a certain FileOutputStream and ObjectOutputStream are ran, they don't build upon previously written data to files from previous runs. Instead, the files are reset to their default states at the start of the program (usually empty), and data is written to them from there (overwriting files).\n",
    "* serialVersionUID is usually a private, static, final, and long, and is a pre-defined unique identifier for a specific class. The purpose of this variable is to make sure that the class of a de-serialized object is the exact same as the class it was serialized as. The pre-defined serialVersionUID may be changed for a certain class by the programmer if the version of that class changes (i.e. attributes and methods are updated, so the programmer changes the serialVersionUID to make it so that the current version of the class is incompatible with previously serialized objects of an older version of the class) If serialVersionUID for an object of a particular class has somehow changed after de-serialization, the program will output an InvalidClassException runtime error."

    "* In Java, a thread is essentially a directional path that is ran through during the program's execution. Most programs have at least one thread, known as the main thread, which allows for the program's execution. Having multiple threads helps the program to be more efficient, as it is able to perform many tasks at the same time. To achieve this, programmers often implement the Runnable or Callable interface into their classes.\n",
    "* The transient keyword defines a property of a class as un-serializable, meaning it will not be converted into a byte stream and will not be saved into a file, database, or over a network. An object will maintain the values of any transient variables before serialization, but after the process of serialization and de-serialization, its transient variables' values will be erased and instead have Java's respective data type default values.\n",
    "* In Java, all instance variables of a serializable class will be serialized, static variables will not be serialized and will default to the current value set by the class after de-serialization, transient variables will not be serialized, and super class variables will be serialized if the super class is serializable. It is important to note that during the de-serialization process, the program creates a new instance of the object in memory, but does not actually invoke the constructor call, as it instead bypasses it, populating the object's data with its original state and fields from the de-serialized information (with the exception of transient variables which are not serialized and static variables, which are given the current value set by the class itself)."

    "## Notes: ##\n",
    "* Java follows the system of passing by value, which often occurs in passing arguments to methods or constructors.\n",
    "* Passing by value for primitive data types means that whenever a value or variable value is passed as an argument to a method or constructor, the program creates a copy of that value for the parameter variable to store into new memory, instead of an actual reference to the primitive variable. This means that changes made to the parameter variable do not affect and are not connected to the argument variable. This also implies that the name of the argument variable doesn't really matter, as once it is passed to the method/constructor, its value will be copied to the parameter variable, and the program will perform operations on the parameter instead of the actual argument.\n",
    "* The normal scope of a variable is limited to the closest enclosing block, or curly parentheses, meaning it cannot be accessed outside of the block, but can be accessed and changed anywhere within the block (even within inner code blocks). This sort of explains the phenomenon of passing by value, since the argument value and parameter value are not even in the same code block.\n",
    "* Just a reminder that the Java compiler normally executes code in a sequence from the top to bottom of the program. Statements such as loops can loop the reading of the code back to a certain point of the program after certain code has been read, and will continue doing so until a halting condition has been met.\n",
    "* In Java, method overloading is where we create multiple methods of one class with the same name but with different parameters (can be different number of parameters or different data types of parameters). We can have 2 methods with the same name and parameters if they are from separate classes, since they are called/referenced by different objects (or classes if the methods are static) anyway.\n",
    "* When declaring primitive data in Java, the program allocates enough memory to store any value fits that data type (e.g. enough memory for maximum value of int). But when declaring non-primitive data, or objects, in Java, the program allocates memory for an address/reference to the actual memory of the object data.\n",
    "* Passing by value for non-primitive types is similar to that of passing by value for primitive types, but instead of the program creating a copy of the value itself, it creates a copy of the reference to the object passed. Because the parameter object variable refers to the same object as the argument object variable, changes made to the parameter object variable via the object's defined methods (or dot notation) will actually affect the argument object variable. This means that whenever the object is modified ANYWHERE in the program (usually by the object references that address it), the memory storing its data is actually modified. \n",
    "* However, if the parameter object reference is assigned to a new object, the parameter variable will now refer to a different area of memory, since the new keyword creates heap memory for a new object. This means that any subsequent changes to the object referenced by the parameter variable do not affect the object referenced by the argument variable, since the parameter and argument now refer to different objects.\n",
    "* Just to review, in Java, you cannot define a variable (meaning declaring variable type and name) more than once within the same code block, meaning every variable in a code block must have a unique variable name."
