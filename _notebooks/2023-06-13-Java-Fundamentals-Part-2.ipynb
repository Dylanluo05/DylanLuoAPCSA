    "* Packages in Java allow you to organize your code in a way that helps you find necessary files/classes quickly. They also assist in preventing conflicts in class names (e.g. 2 classes with the same name will not conflict if they are in separate packages).\n",
    "* The naming convention of package names is typically lowercase, with no spaces nor underscores (package names are usually concise).\n",
    "* Use the package keyword the specify the package a file is a part of, and use the import keyword to be able to implement that file from a separate file/class. The * keyword in an import statement indicates that all of the files/classes of the package will be imported.\n",
    "* Packages in Java follow a hierarchy, which means that you can have packages within packages. Slashes (/) are used to indicate/separate sub-folders, while dots (.) are used to indicate/separate sub-packages.\n",
    "* Package names should be unique in the whole world, so that code can be redistributed effectively without any conflicts. The naming convention of unique package names is first putting either your name (full name) or reversing the name (order of words) of your organization's website, then putting the sub-package name that indicates the purpose of your package."

    "* In Java, interfaces are implicitly abstract (you do not need to declare them with the abstract keyword), and the methods within them are in turn implicitly public and abstract. Interfaces do not contain code that perform actions, but rather the headers of defined methods and sometimes variables (usually public, static, and final).\n",
    "* Interfaces are ultimately used to achieve abstraction, where they group related methods that all have empty bodies. Interfaces are accessed with the \"implement\" keyword from another class, and that class defines the bodies of the interface methods, thus overriding (redefining the method to have a body but with the same exact name) the interface method. Distinct classes can define a particular interface's methods differently.\n",
    "* Similar to abstract classes, interfaces cannot be used to initialize objects (where the interface name follows the new keyword), and do not have \"bodies\" of code. An interface is implemented by separate classes, in which all of the methods defined in the interface must be overridden with method bodies of code defined in the class. It is important to note that a class can implement multiple interfaces (in contrast, a class can only extend one parent class), and an interface can be implemented by multiple classes (a parent class can be inherited by multiple child classes).\n"

    "* When referencing an attribute or method of a particular class within that class itself, you do not need to prefix the variable name. In other words, notation like objectName.variableName is unnecessary, since variableName works by itself. This means that the access modifier does not matter; as long as you are referencing the variable within the same class, you can directly access it by name or optionally prefix dot notation.\n",
    "* Just for review, you typically should have one (and only one) public class in a file, and that public class's name should match the name of the file. However, you can have as many non-public classes with different names in the file as you want.\n",
    "* Access modifiers define the access level of attributes, methods, classes, and constructors, while non-access modifiers do not define the access level, but rather other forms of functionality.\n",
    "* Encapsulation is typically used to keep certain attributes or methods of a class hidden/private from the rest of the world, for the purpose of controlling the way people access these variables, and preventing unnecessary changes from happening to them. \n",
    "* Usually when we declare a particular variable public, that variable is defined as static and/or final, which means it belongs and remains constant (or has a constant change if final is not declared) to the class itself, so that it is relatively unchangeable by others.\n",
    "* The order in which modifiers appear does not necessarily matter all of the time, but there is a recommended order.\n",
    "* The public access modifier defines a class, attribute, method, or constructor as directly accessible to all other classes.\n",
    "* The private access modifier defines an attribute, method, or constructor as only directly accessible within the class it is declared in (can be accessed with getter methods from other classes though). Private variables are not inherited by child classes.\n",

This means that protected variables are inherited by child classes.\n",

A child class can inherit default access modified variables from the parent class only if it is in the same package. It is possible for a child class to extend a parent class in another package using the import feature, but in that case, default variables are not inherited."
