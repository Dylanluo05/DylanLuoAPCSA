    "* Packages in Java allow you to organize your code in a way that helps you find necessary files/classes quickly. They also assist in preventing conflicts in class names (e.g. 2 classes with the same name will not conflict if they are in separate packages).\n",
    "* The naming convention of package names is typically lowercase, with no spaces nor underscores (package names are usually concise).\n",
    "* Use the package keyword the specify the package a file is a part of, and use the import keyword to be able to implement that file from a separate file/class. The * keyword in an import statement indicates that all of the files/classes of the package will be imported.\n",
    "* Packages in Java follow a hierarchy, which means that you can have packages within packages. Slashes (/) are used to indicate/separate sub-folders, while dots (.) are used to indicate/separate sub-packages.\n",
    "* Package names should be unique in the whole world, so that code can be redistributed effectively without any conflicts. The naming convention of unique package names is first putting either your name (full name) or reversing the name (order of words) of your organization's website, then putting the sub-package name that indicates the purpose of your package."
