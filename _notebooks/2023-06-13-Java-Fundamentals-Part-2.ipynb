    "* Packages in Java allow you to organize your code in a way that helps you find necessary files/classes quickly. They also assist in preventing conflicts in class names (e.g. 2 classes with the same name will not conflict if they are in separate packages).\n",
    "* The naming convention of package names is typically lowercase, with no spaces nor underscores (package names are usually concise).\n",
    "* Use the package keyword the specify the package a file is a part of, and use the import keyword to be able to implement that file from a separate file/class. The * keyword in an import statement indicates that all of the files/classes of the package will be imported.\n",
    "* Packages in Java follow a hierarchy, which means that you can have packages within packages. Slashes (/) are used to indicate/separate sub-folders, while dots (.) are used to indicate/separate sub-packages.\n",
    "* Package names should be unique in the whole world, so that code can be redistributed effectively without any conflicts. The naming convention of unique package names is first putting either your name (full name) or reversing the name (order of words) of your organization's website, then putting the sub-package name that indicates the purpose of your package."

    "* In Java, interfaces are implicitly abstract (you do not need to declare them with the abstract keyword), and the methods within them are in turn implicitly public and abstract. Interfaces do not contain code that perform actions, but rather the headers of defined methods and sometimes variables (usually public, static, and final).\n",
    "* Interfaces are ultimately used to achieve abstraction, where they group related methods that all have empty bodies. Interfaces are accessed with the \"implement\" keyword from another class, and that class defines the bodies of the interface methods, thus overriding (redefining the method to have a body but with the same exact name) the interface method. Distinct classes can define a particular interface's methods differently.\n",
    "* Similar to abstract classes, interfaces cannot be used to initialize objects (where the interface name follows the new keyword), and do not have \"bodies\" of code. An interface is implemented by separate classes, in which all of the methods defined in the interface must be overridden with method bodies of code defined in the class. It is important to note that a class can implement multiple interfaces (in contrast, a class can only extend one parent class), and an interface can be implemented by multiple classes (a parent class can be inherited by multiple child classes).\n"

    "* When referencing an attribute or method of a particular class within that class itself, you do not need to prefix the variable name. In other words, notation like objectName.variableName is unnecessary, since variableName works by itself. This means that the access modifier does not matter; as long as you are referencing the variable within the same class, you can directly access it by name or optionally prefix dot notation.\n",
    "* Just for review, you typically should have one (and only one) public class in a file, and that public class's name should match the name of the file. However, you can have as many non-public classes with different names in the file as you want.\n",
    "* Access modifiers define the access level of attributes, methods, classes, and constructors, while non-access modifiers do not define the access level, but rather other forms of functionality.\n",
    "* Encapsulation is typically used to keep certain attributes or methods of a class hidden/private from the rest of the world, for the purpose of controlling the way people access these variables, and preventing unnecessary changes from happening to them. \n",
    "* Usually when we declare a particular variable public, that variable is defined as static and/or final, which means it belongs and remains constant (or has a constant change if final is not declared) to the class itself, so that it is relatively unchangeable by others.\n",
    "* The order in which modifiers appear does not necessarily matter all of the time, but there is a recommended order.\n",
    "* The public access modifier defines a class, attribute, method, or constructor as directly accessible to all other classes.\n",
    "* The private access modifier defines an attribute, method, or constructor as only directly accessible within the class it is declared in (can be accessed with getter methods from other classes though). Private variables are not inherited by child classes.\n",
    "* The protected access modifier defines an attribute, method, or constructor as only accessible within the same package (implies same file too) and any subsequent subclasses (even subclasses in separate packages, unlike the default access modifier) of the class it is declared in. This means that protected variables are inherited by child classes.\n",

A child class can inherit default access modified variables from the parent class only if it is in the same package. It is possible for a child class to extend a parent class in another package using the import feature, but in that case, default variables are not inherited."

    "* Polymorphism, which means \"many shapes/forms\", involves the process of creating multiple classes that related to each other in some way through the inheritance of a super class. It is efficient in allowing code reusability amongst different classes. Polymorphism also states that an object of a sub-class can also have the variable type of the super-class (i.e. SuperClass variableName = new SubClass()). \n",
    "* However, it is important to note that the initialized variable type of an object variable defines the attributes and methods the variable has access to (can only access those listed in the class of the variable type), while the initialized object type of the variable defines the values of its attributes and the actions of its methods (the values and code defined in the class of the object type).\n",
    "* As inheritance allows different sub-classes to inherit the attributes and methods of a super class, polymorphism gives us the ability to take those attributes and methods and perform different kinds of tasks amongst different sub-classes that are each somewhat related to each other. Polymorphism basically gives sub-classes the ability to override the attributes and methods defined in the super-class.\n",
    "* Example: The Animal super-class, which has a sound() method, is inherited by the Pig, Cat, and Dog sub-classes. Pig, Cat, and Dog, will each have their own unique implementation/override of the inherited sound() method."

    "* The purpose of encapsulation (Using access modifiers like private or protected) is primarily to purposely hide some of the inner-workings/elements of a particular class from the public. This prevents direct access to certain attributes or methods of the class, restricting users from directly accessing the state values of those variables. The state/inner values and actions of encapsulated attributes and methods are usually intended to only be directly used within the class (they are typically indirectly used outside the class). Encapsulation is also useful for preventing conflicts in variables amongst different classes. A state value of a variable refers to its instantaneous value during any point of the program's execution.\n",
    "* Encapsulated variables are typically accessed outside the class with getter and setter methods for those specific variables. The getter method allows users to read values of encapsulated variables, while the setter method allows users to change values of encapsulated variables, all-the-while the inner-workings of the class are modified but hidden away from the public for privacy and security. Getters and setters allow encapsulated attributes and methods to be applied toward external purposes outside of the class.\n",
    "* The accepted good practice is that whenever you can make a certain variable (attribute or method) private, make it private; if the variable needs to be inherited by child classes, make it protected; and if the user should be able to access the variable, make it public. Most data should be encapsulated, with the exception of constant variables.\n",
    "* An API stands for Application Programming Interface, which essentially allows the public to access certain features and functionalities of a program.\n",
    "* An API documentation is essentially a collection of references, descriptions, and examples (such as different kinds of attributes/methods and constructors, as well as the API's properties) that show users how to use and employ the functionality of a particular API."
