    "* Packages in Java allow you to organize your code in a way that helps you find necessary files/classes quickly. They also assist in preventing conflicts in class names (e.g. 2 classes with the same name will not conflict if they are in separate packages).\n",
    "* The naming convention of package names is typically lowercase, with no spaces nor underscores (package names are usually concise).\n",
    "* Use the package keyword the specify the package a file is a part of, and use the import keyword to be able to implement that file from a separate file/class. The * keyword in an import statement indicates that all of the files/classes of the package will be imported.\n",
    "* Packages in Java follow a hierarchy, which means that you can have packages within packages. Slashes (/) are used to indicate/separate sub-folders, while dots (.) are used to indicate/separate sub-packages.\n",
    "* Package names should be unique in the whole world, so that code can be redistributed effectively without any conflicts. The naming convention of unique package names is first putting either your name (full name) or reversing the name (order of words) of your organization's website, then putting the sub-package name that indicates the purpose of your package."

    "* In Java, interfaces are implicitly abstract (you do not need to declare them with the abstract keyword), and the methods within them are in turn implicitly public and abstract. Interfaces do not contain code that perform actions, but rather the headers of defined methods and sometimes variables (usually public, static, and final).\n",
    "* Interfaces are ultimately used to achieve abstraction, where they group related methods that all have empty bodies. Interfaces are accessed with the \"implement\" keyword from another class, and that class defines the bodies of the interface methods, thus overriding (redefining the method to have a body but with the same exact name) the interface method. Distinct classes can define a particular interface's methods differently.\n",
    "* Similar to abstract classes, interfaces cannot be used to initialize objects (where the interface name follows the new keyword), and do not have \"bodies\" of code. An interface is implemented by separate classes, in which all of the methods defined in the interface must be overridden with method bodies of code defined in the class. It is important to note that a class can implement multiple interfaces (in contrast, a class can only extend one parent class), and an interface can be implemented by multiple classes (a parent class can be inherited by multiple child classes).\n"
